BoxR 3D Printer by SMW3D aka Hobby-Fab (with Eric Lien)

The BoxR 3D Printer is a larger format cartesian x/y gantry printer with a moving z-axis bed. The BoxR printer was a project that Brandon Satterfield and I worked on together as a possible product he could sell under his SMW3D / Hobby-Fab business. I have had the pleasure of knowing Brandon Satterfield for many years through the now defunct Google+. Over those years I have had the pleasure of working on many cool project with Brandon and the team at SMW3D. Alas the advent of the CR-10, Ender3, and similar Chinese printers put the skids on this project after the first two prototypes were built. There are only two of these printers currently in the wild. I have one, and Brandon Satterfield has the other.  

Unfortunately the Chinese market spurring the race to the bottom on maker parts, kits, and printers drove Brandon and his team on to greener pastures via the closure of Hobbyfab in 2019. But I am delighted to announce that Brandon has given me the OK to release the designs and plans on many of the cool machines we developed together out here on Github. The files here are my best attempt to cleanup and document via detailed 3D models the BoxR 3D printer as we left off on the project. I still use my BoxR Printer regularly, and actually had it out at MRRF the last few years. If you have interest in building one, all the details to get you started should be available in this Github.

I have the 3D model files saved in several formats. I work in Solidworks natively, but I have also exported the model into Fusion360, X_T, Step, 3D-PDF. In addition I have generated a DXF for the plates that make up the major fabricated components.

In addition to the models, I have included several prints, and 2D DXFâ€™s to aid a perspective maker in replicating this capable 3D Printer.

I would like to end this by saying Brandon and his group over the years they were in business did amazing work for the community. They sponsored projects to many makers via at cost or free components to develop cool projects. They were always available to answer questions to potential makers on the kits and projects they sold (day or night). The maker community lost something special with the closure of SMW3D/Hobby-Fab. But the impact they left on the maker community will live on.

Thank you Brandon and team. You are amazing. And I am glad to have been but a small part in your chapter of the Maker Revolution story.
