Instructions-

1. copy the contents of the firmware folder to an SD card then insert the card into the readeron the MKS TFT Display. I am using the 3.2" varriant and that is all that will work with this OS. 
2. Power on the board, it will automatically install the firmware. 
3. Once it powers on you are ready to go!
